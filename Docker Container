install one container and deploy sample html application

first to check images in current machine 
  sudo docker images
  
check containers are avalibale (running and existed)
  sudo docker ps (showing all containers)
  sudo docker ps -a (showing running containers)
  
go to docker hub and check ubuntu operation system image
  
now run ubunut image (pull the image)
  sudo docker run -it ubuntu:latest bash
  sudo docker ps -a

check updates and install nginx web server top of container above
  apt-get update
  apt-get install nginx -y
  
By default nginx server comes with default port "80" check location as
  cat /etc/nginx/sites-avaliable/defualt 
  
Run nginx in container after installed
  ps aux
  
Then type nginx and enter and check again
  ps aux (showing nginx is runnig)
  
 Then install crul 
   apt-get install curl -y
   
 check curl command as localhost
   curl localhost:80
   so inside thek container it works
   
 The last step exit the container 
 
 check containers 
   sudo docker ps -a  (it showing exited)
